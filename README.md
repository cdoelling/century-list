# Century List
## If you had a century to live, what 100 things can you accomplish

> Guideline: Items can be changed and replaced at any time. Take care to update every year, preferably at the start of each new year as you will have the most motivation to think reflectively.  Think big and barrow vigorously from others in what they have accomplished.

>Law: Once an item is completed it stays on the list, you can only alternate what is left.
